When the item is expanded, the pivot displays the calculated values for the individual parts, e.g. April 1, April 2, etc. When the item is collapsed, the pivot displays the calculated TOTAL result of the values. This result is generated by the underlying calculation engine of the pivot grid and we cannot manipulate it on code level.
