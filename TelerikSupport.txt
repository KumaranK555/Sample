I am facing one problem with telerik radpivotgrid.  Please find the image with name "dataset.png",  which is the datasource I am assigning.

From datatable you can find four columns as STATE_LINK, LINKCITY1, ConsumptionQTY And ConsumptionRate. I am assigning STATE_LINK And LINKCITY1 As Rowfield And Other Two Column As Column Field, but I am getting result as shown in image "TelerikResult.png".

In Result column value is not displaying. I need to show it as the image "RequiredResult.png".

Only RowField shold get grouped and column field should not be grouped.

Is there any possibility to avoid grouping column field in radpivotgrid?
